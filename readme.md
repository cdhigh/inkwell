# Additional Features  

## AI-Assisted Q&A with Reading Highlights  
You can send selected reading highlights to the AI for further exploration, gaining deeper insights or understanding.   
### Access options:  
1. Use the `--clippings` startup argument.  
2. Enter `c` in the main interface.  
3. Enter `c` in the menu.  

## Exporting Conversations  
As **kterm** has limited scrollback and poor long-dialogue handling, Inkwell can export conversations as eBooks for better navigation and readability. Exported eBooks automatically appear in the Kindle library and can be emailed if SMTP settings are configured.  

Example commands:  
```  
e0: Export current conversation.  
e1: Export the first history conversation.  
e1-3: Export conversations 1 to 3.  
e1,3-5: Export conversations 1, 3, 4, and 5.  
```  

## Menu Command Overview  
- **`0`**: Return to the current conversation.  
- **`1` or higher**: Switch to a specific history conversation and continue chatting.  
- **`c`**: Open **clippings** for AI-assisted Q&A.  
- **`d`**: Delete one or multiple history conversations (e.g., `d0`, `d1-3`).  
- **`e`**: Export one or multiple history conversations (e.g., `e0`, `e1-3`).  
- **`m`**: Temporarily switch models (add `!` to save to configuration).  
- **`n`**: Start a new conversation.  
- **`p`**: Switch prompts (refer to custom prompt section).  
- **`q`**: Exit.  
- **`?`**: Show command help.  

## Custom Prompts  
Inkwell supports easy switching between prompts:  
1. Enter a custom prompt during configuration.  
2. Edit `custom_prompt` in the configuration file and set `prompt` to `custom`.  
3. Add prompts to `prompts.txt` in the Inkwell directory. Example format:  
   ```  
   prompt_name  
   content line1  
   content line2  
   ...  
   </>  
   another_prompt_name  
   content line1  
   ...  
   </>  
   ```  

# Additional Information  
1. Inkwell runs on **kterm**. Basic kterm operations include two-finger taps for the menu, font scaling, keyboard toggling, and screen rotation.  
2. For custom keyboard layouts, use the [kterm keyboard designer](https://github.com/cdhigh/kterm_kb_layouter).
